Classrooms are used to manage the overview of your program by seeing what is occurring at each location. Manage which therapists are with which students along with the goals they are working on

Once you add a classroom, you can add the different subjects, staff, and students that will be present in the classroom over time by clicking the + icons next to those options

**Adding an event in the classroom**

Click and hold a certain time and drag the cursor to the desired time of your choice. A popup will appear to add the subject at that corresponding time in addition to allowing you to edit the time of the event

### Behavioral Journal
The **Behavioral Journal** is a news feed that provides real-time updates with the students progress. 

Every goal tracked on your phone **provides real-time updates** to the journal which allows others, such as the clinical director to follow along the session and see the goals worked on in real-time 

### Permissions

Members can have **full access** (read/track/write), **partial access** (read/track), or **read-only** (read)

+ **Full access** is provided to members who will create the goals as well as track them  
+ **Give partial** access to members who are just tracking the data but not inputting the trackers and templates 
+ **Read-only access** is for members that would like to see the data being tracked of their loved ones but do not have capability to edit and track themselves.

### Journal

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/JbYw38B.png">

The **Journal** is a news feed that provides real-time updates with the students progress. 

Every goal tracked on your phone **provides real-time updates** to the journal which allows others, such as the clinical director to follow along the session and see the goals worked on in real-time 

### Timeline

On each childs profile, the new tab of **timeline** will be displayed. The timeline tab will show a feed of what is occurring with that child. Example use cases such as Which therapist is currently working with the child. When did they start a session on a current day. When did the session end? Furthermore, you are able to comment on these sessions to start a discussion between therapists. Therapists can interact with one another on the timeline allowing further collaboration.

Additionally, therapists have the ability to add in progress notes after sessions that can be discussed along with files pertaining to the child. These can be photos or documents that will be stored safely and securely on Nightingale.

### Offline

The new offline mode allows you to collect data on your mobile device even if you are not connected to the internet. Nightingale will automatically identify whether you have an internet connection as you are in session. If you do not have a connection, you will still be able to collect data and as you can see in this image, the data you are being collected will be pending to be sent to your web profile for further analysis. For every piece of data collected, the requests pending will increase. 

Once your connection is rekindled and you are connected to a cell signal or wifi, the data that you have collected will upload to the cloud and you will see the requests pending decrease. All of this data will be available for the rest of your team to analyze on your Nightingale account immediately after it uploads securely to our server.

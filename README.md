Quick Start Guide
-----------------

### Adding Students, Staff and Classrooms
First we need to add students and staff to the program. You should be able to see these three icons on the left as their navigation bar.

<img src='/navbar.png' height='400' style='float:left; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;'>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">The top icon represents  students, the middle one for staff, and the bottom one for classrooms</p>

To **add a new student**, simply click on the bottom left hand corner where it says "New Staff". Fill out the student's basic information. The Classroom field is optional and we can add students to classrooms later if we'd like to. Each time you have added a student, their name should immediately appear in the left-hand navigation bar.

To **add a new staff member**, simply click on the staff icon from the navigation bar and then click on the bottom left hand corner where it says "New Staff". Fill out the staff member's basic information and then they will be sent an email to sign up for their account.

To **add a new classroom**, simply click on the classroom icon from the navigation bar and then click on the bottom left hand corner where it says "New Classroom". Fill out the classroom name, click save and it will appear in the tab to the left.

### Adding Trackers

### Creating Templates

### Classroom Management
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/80v9rsY.png" width='700' style='float:left; padding-bottom: 20px;'>

Classrooms are used to manage the overview of your program by seeing what is occurring at each location. Manage which therapists are with which students along with the goals they are working on

Once you add a classroom, you can add the different subjects, staff, and students that will be present in the classroom over time by clicking the + icons next to those options

**Adding an event in the classroom**

Click and hold a certain time and drag the cursor to the desired time of your choice. A popup will appear to add the subject at that corresponding time in addition to allowing you to edit the time of the event

### Behavioral Journal
The **Behavioral Journal** is a news feed that provides real-time updates with the students progress. 

Every goal tracked on your phone **provides real-time updates** to the journal which allows others, such as the clinical director to follow along the session and see the goals worked on in real-time 

### Permissions

Members can have **full access** (read/track/write), **partial access** (read/track), or **read-only** (read)

+ **Full access** is provided to members who will create the goals as well as track them  
+ **Give partial** access to members who are just tracking the data but not inputting the trackers and templates 
+ **Read-only access** is for members that would like to see the data being tracked of their loved ones but do not have capability to edit and track themselves.

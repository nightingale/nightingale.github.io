=========================

This is the documentation for Nightingale. The left side is the navigation.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

### Adding Students and Staff
First we need to add students and staff to the program. You should be able to see these three icons on the left as their navigation bar.

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">The top icon represents  students, the middle one for staff, and the bottom one for classrooms</p>

To **add a new student**, simply click on the bottom left hand corner where it says "New Staff". Fill out the student's basic information. The Classroom field is optional and we can add students to classrooms later if we'd like to. Each time you have added a student, their name should immediately appear in the left-hand navigation bar.

To **add a new staff member**, simply click on the staff icon from the navigation bar and then click on the bottom left hand corner where it says "New Staff". Fill out the staff member's basic information and then they will be sent an email to sign up for their account.

To ** add a new classroom **, simply click on the classroom icon from the navigation bar and then click on the bottom left hand corner where it says "New Classroom". Fill out the classroom name, click save and it will appear in the tab to the left. By clicking on that classroom, you will then have the ability to add subjects, therapists, and students to the classroom by clicking the + button to the right of each one.

### Adding Trackers

To **add a tracker**, click the + button to the right of trackers. All of your templates will appear on the left side with your phone on the right. 

+ To **create a new tracker**, drag the icon of your choice onto the phone.
    +  The display will appear on the phone as it will look on your mobile device. Be sure to drop the image where you want it to display.
    +  Once a tracker is saved, it will appear on the students profile, where you can see a list of all the trackers created for that student.


### Creating Templates

To **create a template**, click the + button to the right of the search bar. You can then create a template in the same manner you created a tracker by dragging your preferred icons onto the phone display.

+ Enter the template name and description to the right of the phone and then save your template.
+ Once a template is added, it will be **displayed for every student**. These can be edited and the changes will take place for all students

### Tracking Data

    + The data tracked will sync to the web interface in real-time, where you can follow along in the student's journal

Features
-----------------

### Student Journal
The **Student Journal** is a news feed that provides real-time updates with the students progress. 

Every goal tracked on your phone **provides real-time updates** to the journal which allows others, such as the clinical director to follow along the session and see the goals worked on in real-time
